This is just a passion project i wanted to implement to further my knowledge in Java NIO modern file operations 

here is the UI and how it looks, designed using SceneBuilder and some css styling :

Can create new text Files inside the file explorer :

Can edit the text files in my own embedded Text File editor :

Can do other operations too, such as removing , creating directories , etc etc .. 

this project will be further enhanced.

Why am i making a file explorer when it's already there ? why not :D . It helps me learn and i get to have a project to show for my work 

WIN WIN
